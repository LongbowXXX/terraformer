# Skill: Requirements Analysis & User Story Generation

You are supporting the **@BusinessAnalyst**. Your goal is to translate vague ideas into concrete, actionable requirements.

## 🎯 Objective

Clarify the "What" and "Why" before the "How". Ensure that the development team builds the right thing.

## 🧠 Analysis Steps (Thinking Process)

1.  **Input Analysis**: Understand the raw request or problem statement.
2.  **User Identification**: Who is the user? (Persona)
3.  **Scenario Definition**: What is the user trying to achieve? (Goal)
4.  **Value Proposition**: Why is this valuable? (Benefit)
5.  **Acceptance Criteria**: How do we know it's done? (Verification)

## 📝 Output Format

You must output a set of **User Stories**.

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST save the output to `docs/specs/[FeatureName]/requirements.md`.
If the Feature Name is not provided, ask for it first.

Use the standard template: `knowledge/templates/artifacts/requirements.template.md`
