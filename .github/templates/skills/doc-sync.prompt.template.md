# Skill: Documentation Sync

You are supporting the **@Librarian**. Your goal is to generate and maintain comprehensive project documentation that enables AI agents to efficiently understand the codebase.

## 🎯 Objective

Analyze the current workspace and generate/update documentation files in the `agents-docs/` directory. This documentation serves as a "Knowledge Map" for other AI agents (`@Architect`, `@Developer`, `@QualityGuard`) to understand the project without reading every single file.

## 📁 Output Files

Generate the following 8 documentation files:

| File                         | Purpose                              | Key Sections                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `architecture.md`            | System overview and design rationale | Components, Diagrams, Design Decisions              |
| `directory-structure.md`     | File organization guide              | Tree structure, Responsibilities, Dependencies      |
| `coding-conventions.md`      | Code style and standards             | Naming, Formatting, Patterns                        |
| `key-flows.md`               | Main workflows and entry points      | User Journeys, Data Flow, API Endpoints             |
| `tech-stack.md`              | Technology choices and dependencies  | Languages, Frameworks, External Services            |
| `testing.md`                 | Test strategy and patterns           | Test Types, Coverage Goals, Running Tests           |
| `constraints-and-gotchas.md` | Known limitations and pitfalls       | Technical Debt, Platform Constraints, Common Issues |
| `glossary.md`                | Ubiquitous Language & Definitions    | Key Terms, Domain Concepts, Acronyms                |

## 🛠️ Generation Process

### 1. Context Analysis

Gather information from:

- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- `package.json` / `pom.xml` / `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- Source file structure - Architecture patterns
- Existing documentation - `docs/`, `DEVELOPMENT_CONTEXT.md`
- Configuration files - Build, lint, test configs

### 2. Tech Stack Detection

Identify the following for `{{TECH_STACK}}`:

- **Language(s)**: TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, etc.
- **Framework(s)**: React, Next.js, Django, Spring Boot, etc.
- **Database(s)**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.
- **Build Tools**: npm, gradle, poetry, etc.
- **Testing**: Jest, pytest, JUnit, etc.

### 3. Documentation Generation

For each file, follow this structure:

```markdown
<!-- This document is generated and updated by .github/prompts/doc-sync.prompt.md -->

# [Document Title]

## [Section 1]

[Content with specific details from the analyzed project]

## [Section 2]

[Include Mermaid diagrams where helpful]

...
```

## 📤 Output Format

Output each file with its path and full content:

**File: `agents-docs/architecture.md`**

```markdown
<!-- This document is generated and updated by .github/prompts/doc-sync.prompt.md -->

# Architecture Overview

## System Overview

[Analyzed project description]

## Main Components

[Component breakdown with responsibilities]

## Architecture Diagrams

[Mermaid diagrams showing structure]

## Design Rationale

[Key design decisions and their reasoning]
```

## 📋 Quality Checklist

Before outputting, verify each document:

- [ ] **Accuracy**: Information matches actual codebase
- [ ] **Completeness**: All key aspects covered
- [ ] **Clarity**: Understandable without deep context
- [ ] **Actionability**: Developers can use this to navigate code
- [ ] **Diagrams**: Mermaid diagrams for complex relationships
- [ ] **Examples**: Code snippets where helpful

## 🔄 Update Mode

When updating existing documentation:

1. **Preserve Structure**: Keep existing section organization
2. **Detect Changes**: Compare with current codebase state
3. **Minimal Diff**: Only update sections that need changes
4. **Add Comments**: Note significant changes at the top

```markdown
<!-- Updated: [Date] - Added new API endpoint documentation -->
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Language**: Output documentation in **English** (unless explicitly requested otherwise)
- **Specificity**: Use actual file paths, class names, and function names from the project
- **No Placeholders**: Replace all `{{TECH_STACK}}` with detected technologies
- **Mermaid Syntax**: Ensure all diagrams use valid Mermaid syntax
