# AI Literacy: Human AI-Readiness

## 🛑 Why this matters?

> **"A codebase can only be as 'AI-Ready' as the humans who work on it."**

The Terraformer project transforms your legacy codebase into an **AI-Ready** environment. However, providing AI with the perfect context (`AGENTS.md`) and tools is only half the battle. If the humans collaborating with the AI don't know how to interact with it effectively, the potential is lost.

This document is designed to **upgrade human skills**. Its purpose is to make **YOU** "AI-Ready" — enabling you to lead, direct, and collaborate with your new AI agents efficiently.

## 🎯 Level 1: Paradigm Shift (Beginner)

Stop treating AI as a "search engine" or a "chatbot." Treat it as a **junior teammate** who has read every line of code but lacks "common sense" or "business context."

### Recommended Actions

1.  **Don't Search, Ask**: Instead of Googling specific syntax, ask the AI to write it for your specific context.
2.  **Delegation Logic**: Instead of "writing code," shift to "reviewing code."
    - _Old Way_: Write the boilerplate, then fill in logic.
    - _New Way_: "Generate the boilerplate for a user service in clean architecture," then refine the logic.
3.  **Explain the "Why" (Intent)**: Just as you clarify "Why" and "What" rather than just "How" when gathering business requirements, you must provide this context to the AI (the implementer). If the AI doesn't understand the goal, it can't choose the best implementation. _(Don't become the "incompetent client" for your AI! 😜)_

## 🚀 Level 2: Mastery of Command (Intermediate)

Once you are comfortable, you must learn to **direct** the AI with precision. This is where "Prompt Engineering" (Inter-species Communication) comes in.

### 1. The Art of Direction (Prompting)

Your results are directly proportional to the clarity of your instructions.

- **Be Specific**: "Make it fast" -> "Optimize for O(n) complexity."
- **Provide Persona**: "Act as a Software Architect" yields very different results than "Act as a Developer." (The former focuses on design patterns and trade-offs, while the latter focuses on implementation details.)
- **Chain of Thought**: Ask the AI to "think step-by-step" to reduce errors in complex tasks.

👉 **Deep Dive**: Refer to [Prompting Techniques](../prompting/README.md) for advanced strategies.

### 2. Context Engineering (Giving AI the "Map")

AI is like a super-skilled new hire who joined the team **today**. They know how to write code perfectly, but they know **nothing** about _this_ project.

- **Why it matters**: Without context, AI guesses. It might suggest a library you aren't using, violate architecture rules, or reinvent the wheel.
- **Context is King**: The quality of the output is 100% dependent on the quality of context you provide.
- **How to provide context**:
  - **Reference Files**: Don't just ask "fix this." Open the relevant files so the AI can "see" them (or tag them like `#Main.ts`).
  - **Background Info**: Explain _why_ you are doing this task. "To improve performance" vs "To fix a crash" leads to different code.
  - **Project Knowledge**: This project uses `AGENTS.md` and `docs/` to automate some context, but your specific task context must come from **YOU**.
  - **Mechanics**: Learn how to use [Neighboring Tabs & @workspace vs #file](./context-management.md) to control what the AI sees.

### 3. Understanding Your Teammate (LLM Characteristics)

To lead effectively, you must know your team's strengths and weaknesses.

- **Context Window**: It doesn't remember _everything_ forever. Remind it of critical rules if the conversation gets long.
- **Hallucinations**: It is a creative engine, not a database. It can invent plausible-looking libraries. **Always Verify.**
- **Bias**: It mimics the patterns it was trained on. If you write messy code, it will suggest messy code.
