# Autonomous Growth for Professional Engineers: Survival Strategy as a "Chef" in the Algorithm Age

## **Executive Summary**

In the modern software engineering landscape, the speed of technological obsolescence is accelerating. The rise of Generative AI, the spread of cloud-native technologies, and the sophistication of business requirements have turned the once valid model of "learning on the job" (OJT) into a relic of the past. For young engineers, especially Generation Z who value career autonomy and speed, not engaging in self-study outside of business hours is no longer just stagnation—it signifies the rapid depreciation of their market value as engineers, or essentially, career "death."

This report clarifies the indispensability of self-study for young professionals living as Systems Engineers (SE). Avoiding abstract spiritualism, we use the **metaphor of the "Chef"** to explain this structurally. The decisive difference in ability between a cook who merely handles orders during restaurant hours (business hours) and a chef who experiments with ingredients and new cooking methods after closing (self-study) manifests directly as the difference between a "Coder (Worker)" and an "Architect (Designer)" in modern engineering.

With the "half-life" of technical skills shortening to less than 2.5 years, "intentional learning" separated from daily tasks is essential for engineers to maintain and improve their skills as human capital. This paper comprehensively analyzes the philosophy of "preparation" practiced by top-class athletes like Ichiro and Keisuke Honda, the habits of the top 5% of engineers, and the process of breaking away from being "instruction-waiting" personnel in the Generative AI era, presenting concrete action plans that young engineers should practice starting tomorrow. This is a proposal not for company-mandated learning, but for strategic investment in the engineer's own survival and freedom.

## **Chapter 1: The Chef Metaphor — Redefining Professionalism**

### **1.1 The Decisive Difference Between "Business Hours" and "Prep Work"**

Imagine the kitchen of a top-tier restaurant. During dinner peak time, the kitchen is alive like a battlefield. Orders come in one after another, instructions fly, and dishes are plated with precision. The cooks on the line move their hands with extremely high concentration, processing the work in front of them. At first glance, this scene appears to be the very definition of professional work.

However, let me pose a question: **"Does a Chef develop new recipes in the middle of a dinner rush?"**

The answer is no. Business hours are for "performance." It is where you are required to reproduce already mastered techniques without error and provide the promised value to the customer. If a chef were to act on a whim during a busy service, thinking "Today, I'll experimentally add an unknown spice to this sauce," the quality would become unstable, inviting customer complaints. Business hours are strictly for earning revenue by "selling slices of existing skills."

"Business hours (9 to 5)" for a systems engineer have exactly the same structure. Project work is a "performance" venue where you build and operate systems exactly according to the specifications requested by the customer. There, priority is given to not creating bugs, meeting deadlines, and following existing rules. Risks such as introducing unknown technologies or trying new architectures that might fail are basically not tolerated.

So, when does a chef grow? It is in the silence after the restaurant closes, or when visiting the market on a holiday. Picking up ingredients they haven't handled yet, checking their scent, and repeating trial productions. Burning things, failing, and adjusting the balance of flavors. This "Practice" time is the source that expands the chef's repertoire and creates the menu for the next season.

Engineers are the same. Code written during business hours often stays within the grammar you already know and the frameworks the company has already adopted. If you conduct no technical exploration outside of business hours, you become a cook who can only make "the menu of the current restaurant." The moment the restaurant goes under, or the world's trends change, that cook's skills become worthless.

### **1.2 The Watershed Between "Worker (Cook)" and "Creator (Chef)"**

In the culinary world, there is a clear hierarchy between "Cook" and "Chef." This difference is not just a title, but a difference in attitude toward work and the domain of ability.

| Role                   | Cook                                           | Chef                                                                         | Engineer (Worker)                              | Engineer (Professional)                                                     |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Main Tasks**         | Cutting and grilling ingredients as instructed | Devising menus, managing costs, assuring quality                             | Writing code according to specs, running tests | Designing entire systems, solving business problems, selecting technologies |
| **Required Ability**   | Accuracy, speed, tolerance for repetition      | Creativity, high-level overview, leadership                                  | Syntax knowledge, debugging ability, patience  | Architectural knowledge, domain knowledge, negotiation                      |
| **Source of Learning** | OJT on site (mimicking seniors)                | Visiting outside restaurants, studying other cultures, exploring ingredients | Existing code on site, internal manuals        | Technical books, OSS code reading, conferences, personal projects           |
| **Replacement by AI**  | Easily replaceable by robots/automation        | Hard to replace as AI cannot create "intent" or "narrative" of taste         | Easily replaceable by AI (Copilot, etc.)       | Hard to replace as they use AI as a "subordinate" to design                 |

The biggest trap young engineers fall into is the illusion that "I am growing because I am busy writing code every day." That is like an apprentice cook who continues to chop onions every day believing, "I will eventually become a three-star chef."
Chopping onions will certainly improve your knife skills (coding speed). However, no matter how fast you chop onions, that alone will not help you understand "the taste of a new sauce" or "the composition of a course meal."
"Work" is an activity that consumes existing abilities.
"Learning" is an activity that invests in future abilities.
Do not confuse the two. The era when you could become a full-fledged engineer just by working is a story from 20 years ago when technological change was slow. In the modern age, an engineer who does not do "prep work (learning)" outside of work will end their career remaining a "master of onion chopping" for life. And cruelly, onion chopping is now the task AI excels at most.

### **1.3 The Expiration Date of "Ingredients" for Engineers**

If ingredients are the weapon for a chef, the "technology stack" is the weapon for an engineer. However, there is a decisive difference from the culinary world. It is not the shortness of the "expiration date of ingredients." It is the shortness of the "expiration date of knowledge."

Basic techniques a chef learns, like "how to fillet a fish" or "how to make soup stock," are universal things that haven't changed for hundreds of years. However, in the IT industry, it is a daily occurrence that the "best cooking method (framework or infrastructure configuration)" that was mainstream 5 years ago has become a "deprecated old way" today.

- Early 2010s: Making monolithic apps with Java on on-premise servers was the "correct answer."
- Early 2020s: Cloud-native, microservices, container technology, and AI utilization became the "correct answer."

If a chef insists, "I only make traditional French sauces. I don't want to study the lighter seasoning or fusion cuisine that customers want today," customers will stay away from that shop. Similarly, if an engineer says, "I only know Java Struts. I don't want to study React or AWS," they will be ordered to exit the market.

Being a professional means prioritizing value provision to the customer (user) over your own "likes and dislikes." Learning the latest technology (new ingredients) is not just a matter of intellectual curiosity, but a matter of **Professional Integrity** to continue providing the "best cuisine" to customers. Just as a cook who doesn't research outside of work cannot become first-class, it is impossible for an engineer who doesn't update their technology outside of work to succeed as a professional.

## **Chapter 2: The "Half-life" of Knowledge and the Cruel Formula of Market Value**

### **2.1 Accelerating Skill Obsolescence — The 2.5 Year Wall**

Why is "study" necessary? The reason is not spiritualism, but based purely on statistical facts. We live in an era where the lifecycle of knowledge has shortened dramatically. According to research by IBM and other institutions, the "Half-life of Knowledge" for specialized skills is shrinking at an alarming rate [1].

| Skill Area              | Half-life of Skill (Estimate)             | Implication                                                                                                             |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| General Business Skills | Approx. 5 years                           | Accounting knowledge and marketing basics remain useful relatively long.                                                |
| **IT Technical Skills** | **Less than 3 years (Approx. 2.5 years)** | Half of the latest technology learned at entry-level becomes outdated by the time one becomes a leader in the 3rd year. |
| Cutting-edge AI/LLM     | **Less than 1 year (Months)**             | API specs and prompting best practices are updated on a weekly basis.                                                   |

The fact suggested by this data is heavy. If the knowledge held by an engineer entering as a new graduate is "100," if they do nothing, its value will be "50" in 2.5 years, and "25" in 5 years. In other words, maintaining the status quo is not even "standing still." It is a "rapid fall."
"Years of experience" being proof of skill is a story from an era when technological change was slow. In the modern age, a reversal phenomenon frequently occurs where a young engineer who catches up with the latest technology like crazy (2 years experience, latest knowledge) has a higher market value than a veteran engineer who stopped learning (10 years experience, knowledge from 10 years ago). This is the background behind the decrease in degree requirements in the job market and the shift to emphasizing immediate combat skills (degree requirements dropped from 53% in 2019 to 44% [1]).

### **2.2 The Identity and Reinterpretation of the "Age 35 Retirement Theory"**

Once in the IT industry, the "Programmer Age 35 Retirement Theory" was whispered as plausible. Physical decline or forced career changes to management were cited as reasons, but viewed from a modern perspective, it is correct to interpret this as the age around which **"skill depletion due to lack of study"** is exposed [2].

By the time an engineer who got a job at 22 and only did what was necessary for work turns 35, about 13 years have passed. If the half-life of knowledge is 2.5 years, the knowledge from when they joined is almost zero. If they neglected updates outside of work during that time, all they have at 35 is "internal political power" or "knowledge of specifications for a specific old legacy system." With this, they have no value in the job change market and are treated as high-salary "dead weight."

Conversely, engineers who remain on the front lines and earn high compensation even after 35 are without exception those who have succeeded in **"Pipelining Learning"** [1]. Regardless of age, they greedily incorporate new paradigms (e.g., Web3, Generative AI) and combine them with veteran-specific "domain knowledge" and "problem structuring ability" to demonstrate value that young people cannot imitate.
The "Age 35 Retirement Theory" is not a biological limit, but a "bill for negligence" thrust upon engineers who stopped learning.

### **2.3 "Democratization of Technology" by Generative AI and Intensifying Competition**

NVIDIA's Jensen Huang warns, "AI will not replace you. The person using AI will replace you" [1]. This quote has a double meaning for engineers.

1.  **commoditization of Coding**:
    In the past, "being able to write code" itself had high market value. However, with the advent of AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, the cost of writing syntactically correct code has dropped dramatically. The skill of simply translating specifications into code no longer has scarcity value.
2.  **Expanding Gap in Learning Efficiency**:
    An unbridgeable "gap in productivity and learning speed" creates between engineers who can utilize AI as a learning partner (second brain) and those who cannot [1]. Using AI, you can have documents in unknown languages summarized, sample code generated, and error causes identified instantly. This makes it possible to cycle through learning several times faster than before.

"Young people who don't study" means not only that their knowledge doesn't increase, but that they miss this wave of "AI Leverage." In the AI era, a person without learning motivation is instantly left laps behind by a person with learning motivation equipped with the powerful engine called AI.

## **Chapter 3: Pivot to AI — From "Coder" to "Goal Designer"**

### **3.1 The Endangered Species: "Instruction-Waiting Humans"**

The evolution of AI Agents (AI that autonomously plans and executes tasks) is fundamentally overturning the role definition of engineers. Conventionally, Generative AI was an "excellent specialist" that required specific instructions (prompts) from humans. However, the latest AI Agents are beginning to have the ability to autonomously execute processes—operating browsers, collecting data, analyzing, and reporting—if given an abstract goal (e.g., "Analyze competitor data in this market and create a report") [3].

This evolution is fatal for "Instruction-Waiting Engineers."
Stances like "I can write code if there is a detailed design document" or "I can work if you break down the tasks" are exactly the areas AI Agents excel at. AI follows instructions faster, cheaper, and without complaint than humans. Therefore, the market value of a "human waiting for instructions" drops to the running cost of AI (electricity and API usage fees).

### **3.2 What is Required is a "Goal Designer"**

The figure of an engineer who survives in the AI era is a "Goal Designer" who sets questions themselves and directs AI, a powerful "subordinate," to solve problems [3].
In the chef metaphor, this means transforming from a "prep cook" who cuts vegetables according to a recipe to a "head chef" who decides the restaurant's concept, thinks about the composition of the entire course, and maximizes customer satisfaction.
The skills required to become a "Goal Designer" are on a different layer than traditional programming skills.

- **Problem Discovery & Structuring Ability**: The ability to break down ambiguous business issues into technical solutions (Requirements Definition, Architecture Design).
- **AI Orchestration Ability**: The ability to discern which tasks to delegate to AI and which tasks humans should do, and give appropriate context to AI.
- **Connoisseurship (Review Ability)**: The ability to judge whether the code or artifacts generated by AI truly meet quality standards and are free of security risks.

These abilities cannot be acquired just by doing given tasks. They can only be acquired through "experiments (self-study)" where you set themes yourself, use AI tools thoroughly, and repeat failures.

### **3.3 Survival Strategy for 2025: Acquiring "Agent Thinking"**

The survival strategy for engineers from 2025 onwards lies not in "fighting AI" but in "using AI thoroughly" [4]. To do that, instead of fearing "my job will be taken," you need "Agent Thinking" to decompose your work into "tasks that can be automated" and "tasks only humans can do," and thoroughly delegate the former to AI Agents [3].

For example, creating daily reports, creating tests for routine code, and creating first drafts of documents should be delegatable to AI right now. Use self-study time to experience these "small automations" and build your own workflow. If you can do that, you can devote the saved time to more advanced learning (acquiring domain knowledge, building human relationships, etc.).
Whether you can rotate this positive feedback loop of **"Creation of surplus time through automation → Investment in new learning"** will be the watershed dividing winners and losers.

## **Chapter 4: The Philosophy of Preparation — The Essence of "Effort" Told by the Best**

### **4.1 Learning "Elimination of Excuses" from Ichiro**

When asking about the ideal way of being a professional, the words of baseball legend Ichiro are golden rules for engineers as well. His definition of "preparation" is extremely strict and practical.

"Preparation means eliminating anything that could become an ingredient for an excuse, and doing everything conceivable for that purpose." [5]

In the field of systems engineering, "excuses" are lying around everywhere.
"I didn't know this library had a bug," "The settings for production and development environments were different," "I didn't have enough time due to a sudden spec change." From a professional's perspective, these are all "lack of preparation."

- Did you check release notes or GitHub Issues before using the library? (Preparation called investigation)
- Did you make an effort to eliminate environmental differences using container technology? (Preparation called technology selection)
- Did you design loosely coupled architecture that is resistant to change, anticipating spec changes? (Preparation called architecture design)

Just like practice swings and stretching for Ichiro, reading technical articles and personal development for engineers are "preparation" to reduce "unexpected" events in the real game (project) and guarantee performance. Engineers who don't study outside of work are like batters standing in the box without warm-up exercises. They might get a hit by chance, but they can never leave consistent results for a long time.

### **4.2 "Correct Effort" Preached by Keisuke Honda**

Football player Keisuke Honda provides a perspective that steps further into "effort."

"Preparation decides the match. Above all, I think there is nothing greater than mental preparation."
"You have to make the correct effort. Few people question the fact that you can't succeed just by working hard." [7]

Many young engineers mistake "working hard with overtime" for effort. However, working long hours in an inefficient way is not the "correct effort" Honda speaks of. It is simply "labor" and exhaustion.
For engineers, "correct effort" is nothing other than **"creating a mechanism where you don't have to make an effort."**

- Instead of spending 1 hour on a manual test, spend 5 hours studying to write an automation script that finishes it in 1 minute.
- Instead of worrying about the same bug every time, learn the design pattern that is the root cause and create a structure where the bug never appears again.

Honda also states, "Those who know the method of correct effort are the ones who have produced results" [8]. This suggests the importance of not studying in isolation, but finding a mentor or learning from excellent code in the OSS community. Knowing what top players (engineers at the national team level) are doing and preparing according to that standard is the shortest route to becoming a professional.

### **4.3 "Action Habits" of the Top 5% of Engineers**

So, specifically, what habits do excellent engineers (or students) called the "top 5%" have? According to research, their success factor lies not in high IQ, but in daily action habits [9].

1.  **Habit of Writing**:
    They document what they learned and thought every morning or at the end of the day. By outputting not just code but technical blogs and documents, they fix knowledge and organize their thoughts. "Writing" is the process of converting vague understanding into clear knowledge.
2.  **Time Management (Deep Work)**:
    They hate "interruptions" extremely. They turn off email and Slack notifications and secure time to immerse themselves in deep thinking (Deep Work). Even in self-study time, they have acquired the habit of concentrating for a short time rather than doing it lazily.
3.  **Documentation**:
    "Documentation exists to protect yourself and for your future self" [12]. When solving a problem, by recording the procedure and thought process, the solution time for facing the same problem next time becomes zero. This is exactly the practice of "correct effort" Honda speaks of.
4.  **Continuous Learning**:
    They view learning not as an event (before training or exams) but as a "routine" like eating or sleeping. They always keep their antenna up for new tools and paradigms and have a mindset to enjoy change.

These habits are things you can imitate starting today, even without talent. Just as a chef sharpens their knife every day, engineers can maintain their sharpness only through daily habits.

## **Chapter 5: Career Strategy Theory for Gen Z — For "Autonomy" and "Freedom"**

### **5.1 The Strongest Stability: "Not Depending on the Company"**

In the values of young engineers, especially Gen Z, "Career Autonomy" and "Speed" are extremely important keywords [13]. In Japan, where lifetime employment has collapsed, clinging to one company is nothing but a risk.
Engineers raised only on training and OJT provided by the company may become knowledgeable about that company's "internal systems," but rely on becoming "Galapagos talents" who are not usable once they step outside. We call this a "Company-Dependent Career."
On the other hand, engineers who have acquired versatile skills (Cloud, Containers, AI, Modern Languages) through self-study possess "Portable Skills" usable in any company. This is an "Autonomous Career."
Self-study is not service to the company. It is a self-defense measure to gain mental freedom and bargaining power by keeping the card "I can quit anytime (Market value is high)" in your pocket.

### **5.2 Learning Investment Thinking with "Cost-Performance" and "Time-Performance"**

Gen Z possesses a rational spirit that values "Time Performance (Tai-pa)" and "Cost Performance (Cos-pa)."
So, what is the cost-performance of "study" for engineers?
The way to increase an engineer's market value can be expressed by the following formula [14].
**Market Value = Technical Skill × Rarity × Problem Solving Ability**

- **Technical Skill**: Deepened by daily work + self-study.
- **Rarity**: Jumps up by learning new technologies that many people haven't touched yet (e.g., AI Agent development) early.
- **Problem Solving Ability**: Increased by having a business perspective.

Compared to other professions, "individual skills" are more likely to be directly reflected in annual income for engineering jobs. It is not rare for investing 20 hours of learning (cost) per month outside business hours to master new frameworks or AI utilization techniques to result in a 1 million yen increase in annual income when changing jobs (performance).
Investing in your own brain (human capital) is a "High Cost-Performance" project with far more certain and high returns than stock investment or FX. Research results show that the target annual income for the future is 4-5 million yen [16], but by conducting strategic self-study, it is fully possible to break through this line in your 20s and aim even higher.

### **5.3 The Only Way to Resolve Anxiety**

Many Gen Zs feel anxiety about the future. Will AI take my job? Will my salary not go up?
The only way to resolve this anxiety is to **"Take Action."**
If you do nothing, anxiety becomes reality. However, if you start learning for even 15 minutes starting today, you can get the feeling (self-efficacy) that you are definitely progressing more than yesterday's self.
Just as a chef stands in the kitchen with confidence by maintaining their knives, engineers can walk without fear in an era of drastic change by maintaining their skills.

## **Chapter 6: Action Plan — Framework to Incorporate "Study" into Life**

For engineers who say "I don't know what to do specifically" or "I don't have time" even when told to "study," we present concrete action plans that can be practiced starting tomorrow.

### **6.1 Pipelining Learning (Input)**

To avoid drowning in a flood of information, "systematize" input [1].

1.  **Filtering**:
    Use X (Twitter) or RSS readers to list accounts of reliable engineers and corporate blogs. It is important to create a "Technology-Only Account" where noise (celebrity news, etc.) does not enter.
2.  **Morning 15-Minute Routine**:
    Every morning, use 15 minutes during commute or before work to skim the feeds mentioned above. You don't need to understand everything deeply. Just **create an "Index" in your brain** like "This technology is starting to trend now" or "New features were added to React." It is enough if you can recall "Ah, it was in that article" when details become necessary.
3.  **Utilizing Podcasts**:
    Listen to technical Podcasts during times when you can't use your eyes (commuting, doing chores). Learning from ears increases familiarity with technical terms and helps maintain motivation.

### **6.2 Input Premised on Output (Processing)**

The retention rate of learning just by "reading" or "watching videos" is only 5-10%. On the other hand, the retention rate for "teaching others" reaches 90% [1].

1.  **LT (Lightning Talk) Driven Learning**:
    Entry for an LT (presentation of about 5 minutes) at an internal study session or external meetup. Make the theme "what I will study from now." The forcing function of "I have to present next week" becomes the strongest learning engine.
2.  **Tech Blog/Zenn/Qiita**:
    Summarize what you learned in your own words and publish it. Write it not to be useful to someone, but to organize your own understanding. A stance of "Memorandum for future self" is fine.
3.  **Reverse Mentoring**:
    Teach your boss or seniors about the latest tools (e.g., new ChatGPT plugins) [1]. Providing information utilizing the sensitivity unique to young people is appreciated and deepens your understanding at the same time.

### **6.3 Possessing a "Sandbox" (Output)**

Have a place for "trial production" for engineers.

1.  **Building a Personal Development Environment**:
    Have a "Sandbox" where you can break things freely on your personal PC or cloud environment (AWS/GCP free tier), not the company PC.
2.  **Beyond "Hello World"**:
    Don't just trace tutorials, try making a small app of your own. Themes that keep motivation high like "My own household account book app" or "Update notification bot for my favorite idol" are fine.
3.  **Challenge to Automation**:
    As a practice of "Agent Thinking" mentioned in Chapter 3, try writing a script to automate your daily work. This becomes the learning that combines the most practical benefits.

### **6.4 The "15% Rule" for Those Without Time**

Google's "20% Rule" is famous, but we propose a **"15% Rule"** as a personal strategy.
Allocate about 6 hours out of a 40-hour work week to "investment for the future."
You might say "I don't have that time." But if you continue current work with current skills, time will never be born forever.
Initially, instead of cutting sleep time, cut time staring at SNS on smartphones or useless meetings. Then, shorten work time with shortcut keys and automation tools learned through study, and invest the saved time into further study. This **"Straw Millionaire" style time investment strategy** is the only solution for busy engineers to grow.

## **Conclusion: The Oath of a Professional**

In the culinary world, there is a saying, "A chef's entire life appears on the plate."
The world of engineers is the same. The code displayed on the screen, the designed system, and the written documents vividly show how that engineer faces work daily and how much "preparation" they have done behind the scenes.
A system built by an engineer who does not self-study is somewhat old-fashioned, has low maintainability, and is weak against change. It is like a bland dish made by a chef who has lost passion.
On the other hand, a system built by an engineer who continues to learn is elegant, robust, and gives surprise and joy to the user. It has the power to move customers, like a dish from a Chef who always explores new tastes.
To young engineers.
Do not study because the company or boss tells you to "study."
That is too passive and a boring motive.
Choose to learn yourself to protect your own market value, to get a free career, and above all, to work with pride as a professional of craftsmanship.
In the coming era dominated by algorithms and AI, the value that remains in the end is the "will to set questions yourself, learn yourself, and continue to change."
Now, let's head to the kitchen (PC). However, not to repeat yesterday's recipe, but to create new possibilities.
Be the Chef, not just a Cook.
