# Transparency & Hallucination Management

## Problem

Users may unknowingly treat AI-generated content as "Gold Standard," leading to critical errors if hallucinations go unnoticed. Conversely, users may spend excessive time correcting minor, non-critical AI mistakes, negating the efficiency gains of using AI.

## Solution

Enforce a "Transparency" policy by requiring AI agents to embed a specific generation tag at the top of all created documents. This explicitly labels the content as an AI draft.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Define the Tag**:
    Standardize a comment format (e.g., `<!-- This document is generated by @AgentName -->`).

2.  **Instruction Injection**:
    In the skill or agent definition (`.prompt.md` or `.agent.md`), explicitly instruct the model: _"You MUST include the following tag at the top of the file..."_

3.  **Adopt "Good Enough" Philosophy**:
    Encourage users (via documentation like `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` or `coding-conventions.md`) to treat tagged documents as "Junior Developer Drafts"—verifying key logic but accepting minor formatting or phrasing quirks.

## Example Template

````markdown
# Output Format

Generate the file with the following header:

```markdown
<!-- This document is generated and updated by .github/prompts/my-skill.prompt.md -->

# [Title]

...
```
````

## Benefits

- **Safety**: Explicit warning prompts necessary verification.
- **Efficiency**: Shifts user mindset from "Perfectionism" to "Validation," speeding up reviews.
- **Traceability**: Identifies which agent or prompt created the file.
