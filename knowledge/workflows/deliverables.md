# Deliverables List

[← Back to Workflow](./workflow.md)

In this project, we strictly separate "GitHub Issues (Process/Log)" and "Git Repository (Product Assets)" depending on the nature of the deliverable.

## Management Principles

- **Issue**: The history of "Why it happened", discussions, temporary check results, work logs. (Flow)
- **Git**: The definition of "What it is", specifications, designs, code, persistent documentation. (Stock)

## Persistence of Artifacts

Although Issues are searchable after being closed, the "Source of Truth" for the project must always be reflected in Git.
For example, if a "Specification Change" is discussed in an Issue, the discussion remains in the Issue, but the **Decision must be merged into the Specification (`docs/specs/`) on Git**.
AI supports this "Distillation of information from Issue to Git".
